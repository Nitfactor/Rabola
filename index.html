        <h1>Introducing Rabola</h1> 
        <h3>September 26, 2025</h3>
        <p>An AI-powered market terminal built to personalize stock discovery, research, and portfolio intelligence for individual investors.</p>
        <p>By creating accounts and setting up portfolios, users give the AI deep context to deliver continuous, high-precision insights â€” from company movements and filings to real-time market opportunities.</p>
        <p>Within the terminal, every investor has a professional market identity â€” a profile that reflects their research, activity, and performance.</p>
        <p>Users can choose to make their insights and strategies visible, fostering a transparent, knowledge-driven investing environment where decisions speak louder than opinions.</p>
        <p>Our work today lays the groundwork for a future where advancements in quantum computing redefine how intelligence is applied to markets â€” creating one cohesive system for insight and action.</p>
